My Year 12 IA2 for Digital Solutions. This Task is to design an application that is able to edit, and store patient, clinician, and appointment data for a physiotherapy clinic. The application must be safe, accessible, and easy to use. All code here will not be submitted. So feel free to learn my strategies and my way of building such a task. :)

This task has been coded from 4/03/2024 - 28/03/2024 (Wow! Only just realised it has taken like a month to code this, and sir wanted all this done like 2 weeks ago, so L him.)

More code annotations may come in the future if i feel like it, so code is easier to read and understand.
