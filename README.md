My Year 12 IA2 for Digital Solutions. This Task is to design an application that is able to edit, and store patient, clinician, and appointment data for a physiotherapy clinic. The application must be safe, accessible, and easy to use. All code here will not be submitted. So feel free to learn my strategies and my way of building such a task. :)

Plus i know i should've spread the functions out across more files (example, clinician file and so on) but i just didnt feel like it. plus i wasn't expecting it to be like 1k lines of code
